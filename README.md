# MoToken
This is a basic ERC721 Token that I have created for fun and to learn more about blockchain engineering.

The token has a maximum supply of 10,000 and it costs 0.1 ETH to mint.

The test cases play around with ownership and transfer of ownerships.

## Tests
Run ```npx hardhat test``` to run the test cases for this project.
